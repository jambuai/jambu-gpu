# How shutdown works

The CLI process cannot be responsible for idle shutdown. Close the laptop and a local watchdog dies while the GPU keeps billing. `setup` installs a watchdog on the instance itself:

```
CLI ──provisions──> instance
                      │
                      ├── supervisor (bash respawn loop)
                      │     └── watchdog (HTTP :8777, authenticated)
                      │           ├── holds the activity and heartbeat state
                      │           ├── reads vLLM /metrics for inference traffic
                      │           ├── evaluates the lifecycle policy every 60s
                      │           └── calls the provider API to stop or destroy itself
                      └── vLLM :8000
```

The watchdog script is generated at provision time. The lifecycle policy source is inlined from `jambu_gpu/core/policy.py`, so the remote guard and `gpu status` apply the same rule. The provider adapter injects only the two calls that stop or destroy the machine.

An instance stays billable only while:

1. a workload is running (heartbeat alive), or
2. a workload is queued, or the model is still starting, or
3. the model server is serving requests, or
4. an explicit lock is active.

Anything else becomes `STOPPED` or `DESTROYED`, with the reason recorded.

Activity is a running workload, a queued workload, model startup, inference traffic, or an active lock. A healthy vLLM server, a health check, a metrics scrape, and an open SSH session are not activity. If they were, an idle server would stay up forever.

A crashed CLI, a dropped SSH session, or a sleeping laptop stops the heartbeat. After `lifecycle.heartbeat_grace` the workload is stale, the instance goes idle, and the normal idle rules apply.

## Inference traffic is activity

An agent that calls the vLLM endpoint directly, without `gpu run`, is still using the machine. The watchdog reads vLLM's Prometheus endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics`) every `min(interval, 15s)` and marks activity when:

- a gauge is above zero: `vllm:num_requests_running`, `vllm:num_requests_waiting`, or
- a counter grew since the last successful read: `vllm:request_success_total`, `vllm:prompt_tokens_total`.

The first read only sets the baseline, so totals left over from earlier traffic do not keep the machine up. A counter that goes down means vLLM restarted; it rebaselines and does not count. A probe error is never activity, and it is logged as `activity_probe_error` at most once every 10 minutes. `GET /state` shows the last read under `last_probe` (`ok`, `values`, `last_traffic_at`).

Traffic only feeds the idle timer. It does not override `max_lifetime`, the session budget, or locks.

## Sessions and restarts

A Vast.ai stop keeps the container disk, and the onstart script runs again on every container start. The watchdog state in `/var/lib/jambu/activity.json` therefore survives a stop/start, including the flag that says the instance was already stopped.

The onstart script sets `JAMBU_SESSION_STARTED_AT=$(date +%s)` once per container start and passes it to the watchdog. On boot the watchdog compares it with the stored `session_started_at`:

- **Different** (the instance was restarted): new session. The guard is re-armed, startup grace starts over, `last_activity` is now, workloads left running or queued are marked failed, and retry counters reset. Logged as `session_started`.
- **Equal** (the supervisor respawned a crashed watchdog in the same container start): state is kept.

`max_lifetime`, the session budget (`hourly_cost × session_age`) and startup grace are measured from the session start, not from creation. A restarted instance gets a fresh lease and is not killed the moment it boots. `GET /state` reports both `age_seconds` (since creation) and `session_age_seconds`.

## Retries and escalation

A failed provider call never disarms the guard. A transient API error is logged as `provider_error`, then `guard_retry` with the attempt count, and the guard tries again on its next tick.

When stops have failed continuously for `escalate_after_s` (watchdog config, default 30 minutes), the watchdog destroys the instance instead, if the provider supports destroy (reason `stop_failed_escalation`). A machine that bills forever costs more than a lost disk, but a few minutes of provider API outage is not worth the disk. The failure count and clock reset after a successful call and whenever the decision stops being a shutdown (the instance is in use again), so failures from separate idle spells never add up. A completed manual shutdown clears its pending request.

A successful call does not end the loop either. If the provider accepted the call but the machine is still running after `max(300s, 5 × interval)`, the watchdog issues it again (`guard_reissue`). A failed manual `POST /shutdown` is retried the same way.

## The supervisor

The watchdog runs inside a bash respawn loop started with `nohup`. If the watchdog crashes, the loop logs its exit code to `/var/log/jambu/watchdog.log` and starts it again 5 seconds later. `/var/run/jambu/watchdog.pid` holds the loop's pid; sending it `TERM` stops the loop and the watchdog together. The watchdog still starts before the model server.

## Stopped instances

A stopped Vast.ai instance still bills for storage, and its watchdog is not running. Set `lifecycle.stopped_ttl` and the policy destroys an instance that has been stopped longer than that (reason `stopped_ttl`). This needs destroy support and no active lock. `gpu guard` enforces it from outside, since nothing runs on a stopped machine.

`stopped_since` keeps the first time the CLI saw the instance stopped, but only while nothing says it ran since. A session start, local activity, watchdog contact or a provider start time newer than `stopped_since` means the instance was restarted and stopped again while the CLI was not looking (from the web console, say), so the clock restarts at the current observation instead of destroying a fresh stop.

## A second path

Run the same rule from anywhere that has API access:

```bash
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/experiment && gpu guard
```

`guard` evaluates the policy against reconciled state and enforces it. `gpu sweep --install-timer` runs it for every registered project; see [Keeping the account clean](USAGE.md#keeping-the-account-clean).

Inference traffic is counted on the instance only. When the watchdog is enabled and installed but did not answer during this reconcile, `guard` therefore does not apply `idle_timeout`: its local idle clock would stop an endpoint that is busy serving requests. `max_lifetime`, the session budget and `stopped_ttl` still apply, and the decision detail records `idle_skipped: watchdog_unreachable`. With `lifecycle.watchdog.enabled: false` the CLI guard owns the idle rule as before.

## A model server that dies at boot

The runtime start command writes the model server's pid to `/var/run/jambu/vllm.pid`. `GET /state` reports `runtime_alive`: `true` or `false` from that pid, `null` while there is no pid file yet (or only one older than the current container start). If the process is gone while the instance is still starting, the watchdog logs `runtime_exited` once and ends startup, so the idle rules apply instead of a startup grace (`startup_timeout` + 5 minutes) kept open by a dead server.

`gpu setup` asks the watchdog on every readiness poll. When `runtime_alive` is `false` it fails at once with the last 30 lines of the model server's log in the error (a CUDA driver mismatch, an out-of-memory, a bad flag), and `cleanup_on_setup_failure` destroys the instance.

`GET /logs?name=runtime|onstart|watchdog&lines=N` (authenticated, default 200, at most 2000) serves the tail of those files without SSH. `gpu logs` reads it.

## The watchdog credential

The watchdog stops its own machine, so it needs provider API access. `VAST_API_KEY` is written on the instance at `/etc/jambu/watchdog.json` (mode 600).

Use a dedicated, restricted Vast.ai key for this, not a personal key. Set `lifecycle.watchdog.enabled: false` to opt out. Shutdown then depends on `gpu guard` or on the CLI staying alive, and `validate` warns you.

Four concerns stay independent: model, inference runtime, lifecycle policy, infrastructure provider. The core never branches on a provider name. It branches on `provider.capabilities`.
